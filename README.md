# spring-workbench
### A Personal Workbench for Spring Framework where I am cultivating little workbenches and doing some crazy experiments on them.

There are currently 3 parts of this workbench:
* **spring-workbench**, this is the first one which acts kind of an introduction to Spring Core, Boot, MVC and `SOA`, in addition `DAO` abstraction has been practiced.
* **springDataAndMore**, second one which is kind of a developed form of first one, Spring Data, JPA and Hibernate concepts are practiced generally
* **spring-workbench-3**, the third one which introduces concepts such as `Specification`, `DbProjection`, `DTO` and `ObjectMappers`, in addition Spring Security, Testing and `liquibase` tool are introduced.

All 3 workbenches has their own Postman collection which i personally created to test the apps.
