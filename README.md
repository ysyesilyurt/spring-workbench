# spring-workbench
### A Personal Workbench for Spring Framework where I am cultivating little workbenches and doing some crazy experiments on them.

There are currently 3 parts of this workbench:
* **spring-workbench**, this is the first one which acts kind of an introduction, below	content is practiced:
	* `Spring Core, Boot, MVC`
	* Concepts about Service Oriented Architecture.
    * `DAO` abstraction (as a way to access data).
	* Dependency Injection, IOC Container, REST endpoints
* **springDataAndMore**, second one which is kind of a developed form of first one, below content is practiced:
	* `Spring Core, Boot, MVC`
	* `Spring Data` with `JPA`, and its implementation, `Hibernate`.
	* `Repository` along with `JpaAuditing` structure instead of plain `DAO`s with the help of `JpaRepository` and `PagingAndSortingRepository`.
	* `ResponseEntity` and error handling mechanisms with resource management. 
	* Java's vital data structures, enum and `Optional`.
* **spring-workbench-3**, the third one in which I introduce:
	* `Spring Hateoas` for ultra-Rest practices in Spring-based web applications.
	* `Spring Security` for practicing security concerns (Authentication/Authorization and much more) of web applications and their management in a Spring-based backend. 
	* `DTO`s along with `MapStruct` library to create handy `DTO`s, `DbProjections` and `Models` for internal usage in the application.
	* `liquibase` for practicing manipulations of db tables from codebase. 
	* `jUnit` and `Spring Test` for practicing testing mechanisms of Spring Boot applications.

All 3 workbenches has their own:
* `Postman` collection which I personally created to test the apps.
* `Dockerfiles` to run these apps on docker containers.
